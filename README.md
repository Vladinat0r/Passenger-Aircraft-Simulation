# Passenger-Aircraft-Boarding-Simulation

This software is written in C++ with OpenGL API and simulates aircraft boarding of passengers across 
several aircraft models and boarding strategies.

The simulation accounts for the aircraft dimensions, the passengers' average walking speed, acceleration, deceleration 
and moving past other passengers in order to acquire a realistic representation of the boarding process.

When launching the simulation, it can be run either via console or with graphics and using the "arrow keys", the user 
is required to select the boarding strategy, which entries to use and the aircraft model before starting the simulation 
by pressing "Enter". Once the passengers are boarded, the total time to board and the average time for each passenger 
to reach their seat is displayed. The user can press "Enter" at any time to reset the simulation and go back to 
the simulation settings.
